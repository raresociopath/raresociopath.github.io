Alright, yeah, just like everyone else I've decided to set-up a technical blog.
*Why?* Well, first of all because I'm getting the same questions about my opinion on doing things all over again.
I don't want to repeat myself cause... it's just absorbing my time. Instead, I will just add a couple of answers here and 
put some blueprints with my approach on doing things. Hope it's worth it.


### Optimal solution.

While setting up this blog, I started to think about how I've changed during my 7 years of writing code.

5 years ago I would've spend a couple of days on setting up a blog, writing things from scratch, 
configuring the http servers, the colors and so on... 
And now... I choose not to spend time on things that just don't require that.
A good tech blog is good content, not good design. So, instead of spending time I went with github pages,
downloaded a template and in 5 minutes I'm already writing this article.
I think progressing as a developer, administrator or business person shouldn't be only in terms of 
knowing how to do things but also on how to organize your time in doing things.


Working for outsoucing companies is cool in one way. They make you think in terms of time.
You don't need complicated solutions for thinks that just don't require that.

I could definetely create a blog in java from scratch. Put an application server to work and deploy it there.
But does it make sense to spend time on this?

My approche on chosing is as follows?

When you are an experienced developer/devops you won't spend time on things that you already know.
Working for startups,

What 

My answer is no. Instead I choose to go with github pages that don't require anything else than a template.
So my optimal solution for things like a technical blog is 

### What is github pages and how to create your first tech blog in 3 steps?



### Where can I get some?
