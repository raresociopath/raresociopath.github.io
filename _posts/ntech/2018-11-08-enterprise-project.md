# The start-up project

Before implementing something you should first understand on what kind of project you're gonna work.
In my experience I've managed to delimit a couple of types.

1) The enterprise project
2) The start-up project
3) The personal project 
4) The internal project

Each project type is different and requires different type of thinking and analysis.

Let's start with the ** ENTERPRISE PROJECT **
