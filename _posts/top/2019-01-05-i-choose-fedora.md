title: I Choose Fedora!
category: top

First question I get from developers, devops and architects is what distribution of linux I'm using on my desktop.
Well, there is one and only distribution I used for more than 8 years and will use in the future, 
and that distribution is FEDORA.

Why?
1.  Because it never failed.
2. Because I worked for RedHat.
3. Fedora kernel upgrade is more frequent so you get the latest technology to work with.
4. Fedora releases are rock solid and never came across of any issues.
5. I am a Certified Red Hat Engineer and am most comfortable with rhel/fedora.
6. Because I personally know the developers that work on the distribution and I can tell you that they are hell of a developers.
