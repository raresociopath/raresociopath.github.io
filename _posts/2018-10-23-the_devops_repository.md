A one folder that does it all.
I suggest not to spread the provisioning and deployment scripts,
instead keep them in one repository.
This way, you're not gonna get lost, and so your new devops.

```
<project-name>/
├── ansible # Read more here:
├── k8s # Kubernetes natives
├── terraform # Provisioning scripts
└── README.md
```
