I don’t want to repeat myself cause… it’s just absorbing my time. Instead, I will just add a couple of answers here and put some blueprints with my approach on doing things. Hope it’s worth it.</p> <h3 id="optimal-solution">Optimal solution.</h3> <p>While setting up this blog, I started to think about how I’ve changed during my 7 years of writing code.</p> <p>5 years ago I would’ve spend a couple of days on setting up a blog, writing things from scratch, configuring the http servers, the colors and so on… And now… I choose not to spend time on things that just don’t require that. A good tech blog is good content, not good design. So, instead of spending time I went with github pages, downloaded a template and in 5 minutes I’m already writing this article. I think progressing as a developer, administrator or business person shouldn’t be only in terms of knowing how to do things but also on how to organize your time in doing things.</p> <p>Working for outsoucing companies is cool in one way.

Put an application server to work and deploy it there. But does it make sense to spend time on this?</p> <p>My approche on chosing is as follows?</p> <p>When you are an experienced developer/devops you won’t spend time on things that you already know. Working for startups,</p> <p>What</p> <p>My answer is no. Instead I choose to go with github pages that don’t require anything else than a template.
