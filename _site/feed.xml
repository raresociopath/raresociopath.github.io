        <title>I love ansible.</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Ansible, ansible, ansible, guess everyone has heard at least about Ansible.
But how does it work, how should you use it, why it might help you as well?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-ansible&quot;&gt;Why Ansible?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of “de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum” (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, “Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..”, comes from a line in section 1.10.32.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from “de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum” by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-do-we-use-it&quot;&gt;Why do we use it?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using ‘Content here, content here’, making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for ‘lorem ipsum’ will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;where-can-i-get-some&quot;&gt;Where can I get some?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don’t look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn’t anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hello world?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello world! 
Is that the first thing every IT person starts with?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;optimal-solution&quot;&gt;Optimal solution.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While setting up this blog, I started to think about how my thinking changed in terms of doing things.
If I would have started this blog 7 years ago my hello world would have started differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-changed-you-ask&quot;&gt;What changed you ask?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working for outsoucing companies is cool in one way. They make you think in terms of time.
You don’t need complicated solutions for thinks that just don’t require that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could definetely create a blog in java from scratch. Put an application server to work and deploy it there.
But does it make sense to spend time on this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My approche on chosing is as follows?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you are an experienced developer/devops you won’t spend time on things that you already know.
Working for startups,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My answer is no. Instead I choose to go with github pages that don’t require anything else than a template.
So my optimal solution for things like a technical blog is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-github-pages-and-how-to-create-your-first-tech-blog-in-3-steps&quot;&gt;What is github pages and how to create your first tech blog in 3 steps?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;where-can-i-get-some&quot;&gt;Where can I get some?&lt;/h3&gt;

        <title>How to Download or Use This Theme</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;use-this-theme-as-you-main-site&quot;&gt;Use this theme as you main site&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Download or fork the master branch of this theme repo into your GitHub account.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rename the repo into something like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;your_username.github.io&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Edit &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_config.yml&lt;/code&gt; file to your preferences.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Edit &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;about.md&lt;/code&gt; file for your About page.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Inside &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; folder, there are sample of blog entries. Learn from it and start yours.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Now, visit &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;http://your_username.github.io&lt;/code&gt; and you should see your blog running.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;use-this-theme-as-a-project-page&quot;&gt;Use this theme as a project page&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to use this theme as a project page blog, you don’t need to rename the theme repo into &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;your_username.github.io&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All you need to do, open &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_config.yml&lt;/code&gt; file, change &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;baseurl&lt;/code&gt; to your project name which contains this theme, e.g. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;baseurl: &quot;/myproject&quot;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cheers&quot;&gt;Cheers!&lt;/h4&gt;

        <title>If you have a Guest post..</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If you think that you’re going to have a guest post… take a look on this post sample. Just add &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;author: GuestName&lt;/code&gt; to the YAML front matter. Then, the &lt;strong&gt;GuestName&lt;/strong&gt; will be appear on the next of post date. Oh, the guest name will be automatically uppercase.&lt;/p&gt;
