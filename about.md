Hi, my name is Ion, 23 year's old computer engineer. Currently living in Chisinau, Moldova.
I started programming at the age of 15. Before that I just loved to brake computers and understand
how they work. 

## Mission
**The mission of this blog is to show who I am in terms of technologies.**
Here you'll find articles beggining with what I do when I get a brand clean computer to how I architect 
big, scalable projects from both programming and devops perspective, and articles about how I think things should look like. ;)
Enjoy and have a good day!

**NOTE** All around the blog you'll find quotes I really love in boxes like this. :)

> "Quite frankly, I don't like you humans. After what you all have done,
I find being 'inhuman' a compliment."

I started my career at the age of 17 as a **Java developer**.
Working 16 hours per day I've achieved the senior level in just 4 years.
Worked for at least 10 big projects. 

## A couple of them would be:

1. <a href="https://www.extenda.com/">Extenda</a> ( a POS system that you see in H&M, Apotheket and other shops)
2. <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en">RedHat</a> ( contributing to the Jboss AS, and working for the Jboss EAP )
3. <a href="https://www.telekom.com/en">Deutsche Telekom</a> ( I worked here as a Cloud Consultant for a private cloud solution based on Openstack) 
4. <a href="https://openbet.com">Openbet</a> ( A betting engine that you meet in around 60% of the gambling scene)
5. <a href="https://williamhill.com">William Hill</a> ( Another betting company with the HQ in UK )
6. ...

**NOTE** This are just a couple of companies I'm proud I've worked with.
