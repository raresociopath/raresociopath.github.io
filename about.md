Hi, my name is Ion, 23 year's old computer engineer. Currently living in Chisinau, Moldova.
I started programming at the age of 15. Before that I just loved to brake computers and understand
how they work. 

## Mission
**The mission of this blog is to show who am I in terms of technologies.**
Here you'll find articles beggining with what I do when I get a brand clean computer to how I architect 
big, scalable projects from both programming and devops perspective, and articles about how I think things should look like. ;)
Enjoy and have a good day!

**NOTE** All around the blog you'll find quotes I really love in boxes like this. :)

> "Quite frankly, I don't like you humans. After what you all have done,
I find being 'inhuman' a compliment."

I started my career at the age of 17 as a **Java developer**.
Working 16 hours per day I've achieved the senior level in just 4 years.
Worked for at least 10 big projects. 

## A couple of them would be:

1. Extenda ( a POS system that you see in H&M, Apotheket and other shops)
2. RedHat ( contributing to the Jboss AS, and working for the Jboss EAP )
3. Deutsche Telekom ( I worked here as a Cloud Consultant for a private cloud solution based on Openstack) 
4. Openbet ( A betting engine that you meet in around 60% of the gambling scene)
5. William Hill ( Another betting company with the HQ in UK )
6. ...

**NOTE** This are just a couple of companies I'm proud I've worked with.
